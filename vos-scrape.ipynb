If the HTML were semantic, that is, if the taxonomic relations between category headings and the links were expressed in the HTML structure it would be easier to extract. \n",

    "Instead the HTML structure is flat with a long list of `<tables>` all hanging off the `<body>` of the HTML document. The hierarchical structure is expressed using CSS styles, specifically `width` attributes.

The logic is going to be tricky because there are a few edge cases I'll need to deal with, but I'll deal with those later."
